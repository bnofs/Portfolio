                    <p>I didn't miss one class period or MMG meeting throughout the semester. Earlier in the year, I set up
                        a weekly office hour meeting to stay up to date with everything. This is my highest category not
                        because of the quantity of attendance I've had, but because I have identified that not all attendance
                        is good. Around spring break, I realized that I was going into office hours for the wrong reasons.
                        I sat back one day and listed out the reasons I was continuing to go in, and almost all of those
                        reasons revolved around validation. I took this class for myself, and this helped me realize that
                        office hours were holding back my truly developing. I am very proud of my ability to realize this,
                        and while it may seem like I dissapeared towards the latter part of the semester in terms of office
                        hours, it's what I needed for myself.

                    <p>I have definitely improved over the semester with my email protocol, but I wouldn't say it's anything
                        outstanding. I struggled for a while sending in emails due to the lack of feedback, until I realized
                        (like I said above) that really all I was looking for was validation. I feel much more confident
                        conducting myself in a professional manner over email, and now actually think about what the purpose
                        is behind my message. There were times I forgot about using the correct format, and it took me longer
                        than it should have to set up a signature on my phone. I didn't send a ton of emails throughout the
                        semester, but I hope to continue improving over time until it becomes second nature.

                    <p>This was a toughest of the categories to assess myself on. On one hand, I think I did a great job of
                        setting ambiguous deadlines for myself. I kept a very organized and up-to-date schedule on Trello
                        of everything I had to do and organizing by priority. The reason I could have done better in terms
                        of this class was that some of the assignments or projects we were given were not high on my priority
                        list. For example, I have still yet to do the cultural catch-up assignment and am in the early stages
                        of my manifesto, but that's because I had more important things to do and not because I was procrastinating.
                        If I had to do it over again, I would have done it the exact same way and I'm very proud of that.

                    <p>I came to every class attentive and stayed true to my goal at the beginning of the semester, which was
                        to wake up every day half an hour earlier than I normally do. This allowed me to stay more awake
                        during class and get the most out of each session. There were definitely a lot of takeaways from
                        each class that I wrote down and revisited almost every day, but I could have done a better job using
                        some of the tangible tools we were given(white hat, word dance, fractionation, SCAMPER, etc). I also
                        got a lot of value out of my MMG, where I was able to use my strengths of being analytical and level-headed
                        to guide and support my teammates throughout the semester.
